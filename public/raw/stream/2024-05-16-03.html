    i need to work at X bc i'm addicted to it
    <br/><br/>
    also bc i think it's super useful. maybe the most democratic / social good social media app out there
    <br/><br/>
    also i'm suspended right now (<a href='https://twitter.com/freshman_dev'>@freshman_dev</a>), i think u guys thought i was doing something nefarious, i made a bunch of accounts for friends (to get them on twitter) (also i gotta still mostly call it twitter i'm sorry X is confusing) (x.com is a great url tho i actually own 4-letter tu.fo myself). but now i'm applying to X bc of that (read: addicted. can't get suspended again) so maybe it was good üëç
