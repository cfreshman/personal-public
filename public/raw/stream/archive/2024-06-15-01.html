    Hi! I'm an overachieving software developer with 5+ years of experience. I have a public-facing overview of my business at <a href="https://freshman.dev/about" target="_blank">/about</a>

    - 2y @ <a href="https://freshman.dev">freshman.dev</a> <i><b>now incubating through May 2025 @ RIHub</b></i>
    - 2.5y @ Amazon Robotics <i>with max percent raises per year</i>
    - 3 internships @ MathWorks <i>with full-time offer</i>
    
    I made the difficult decision to leave at both Amazon Robotics and MathWorks, but still appreciate many of the connections I formed at those places. <b>I use the MERN stack</b> for freshman.dev (MongoDB, ExpressJS, <b>ReactJS</b>, <b>NodeJS</b>), overlapping with cal.com's stack

    Right now I'm gearing up to run a makerspace at Meadowbrook Day Camp this summer - I've never run a makerspace before! But <b>I am looking for a full time software development position for the fall</b> - my startup is at MVP, looking for user growth. I just switched my meeting scheduler at <a href="https://freshman.dev/contact" target="_blank">/contact</a> to cal.com (away from HubSpot, design decision) - then saw you were hiring in your v4.2 email

    And I'm going to attempt a cal.com issue tonight! But please go easy on me (only with that) - I did attend camp training today and am expected to hit the ground running on Monday, starting with laser cutting a bunch of camp signs üòà so I am preoccupied but fully committed to an interview process with cal.com. <b>I will be fully available for work starting August 19th</b>

    - Cyrus


    EDIT - i'm tired so i‚Äôm going to provide product feedback tonight instead:

    i, like i‚Äôm guessing ~80% of your users, only use the basic features of cal.com - to provide a way for random people to schedule 15/30/60m meetings on my calendar

    i‚Äôd actually like an even more basic version of cal.com than you provide right now: i want <a href="https://cal.com/freshman">cal.com/freshman</a> to be <a href="https://cal.com/freshman/15min">cal.com/freshman/15min</a> <s>but with 15/30/60m options</s>. so users don‚Äôt have to click through an extra screen when i really just have one event type with different lengths. could maybe provide through added <s>‚Äúlength options‚Äù and</s> ‚Äútakeover cal.com/freshman" in event settings. <s>would be okay to only have "length options" and i'd name it cal.com/freshman/new</s>
    -> WAIT i did check again and you already support multiple durations! although it's not in the initial meeting popup - <b>maybe add it to that?</b> that's why i didn't think it supported that

    EDIT 2 - now that i've tested the duration select, i have one additional comment - switching duration should not take that long to load. you should already have the data in the client to recalculate the open blocks for the new duration. they do cache though, just not ideal to hit another calendar load at first

    EDIT 3 - whoa. ignore the first part of EDIT 1 - you already redirect to the sole event type. nice! ok, so - <b>add variable duration option to simple new event type popup?</b> maybe location too if you default to cal.com video
    
    EDIT 4 - if you have any interest in these signs i'm making they're at <a href="https://freshman.dev/raw/1/meadowbrook.html" target="_blank">/raw/1/meadowbrook.html</a>
