MAIN SELLING POINTS
- made from nothing but peas & rice
- supplement your diet with this new healthy & cheap protein choice once per day
- or go further - save as much money as you can by switching your entire diet
- we all want protein every day so if we're able to get it cheaper - who knows, world peace?

BACKGROUND
- there are 9 amino acids animal bodies don't produce. we need to eat them ideally every day
- meat/whey/quinoa/more have these 9 in good balance
- 1:1 pea-rice does too - cheaper
- it just tastes like weird water oatmeal - be a stoic! (or take a gummy multivitamin after drinking your scoop)
- $600 gets you 88lbs, enough to last you over a year @ 3 scoops or 75g protein per day
- cow farts are roughly as responsible for global temp rise as all car exhaust! switching to pea-rice is one of the best personal choices you can make for the environment 

TRY PEA-RICE PROTEIN TODAY
(these links are for the US, not my products)
- mix 1 scoop each of <a href="https://bulkfoods.com/pure-protein-powders/pea-protein-powder.html">PEA</a> and <a href="https://bulkfoods.com/pure-protein-powders/brown-rice-protein-powder.html">RICE</a> powders (for 25g protein total) in 12oz of water
- <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vegan-Protein-Bundle-Unflavored-Organic/dp/B0BWPWF1ND">STARTER BUNDLE</a>: try it out before committing to 88lbs. comes with scoops you need for the 88lbs. might even get to you today
- if you try it and really don't like it, sell it to someone you know who is more stoic / good at eating healthy things that don't taste so good
- but it is maybe the best cheap & healthy protein on the market
- not ready to commit to $133? 10 servings @ $15 from target: <a href="https://www.target.com/p/gainful-vegan-plant-based-protein-powder-unflavored-10-servings/-/A-87737131?sidd=3333S&ref=tgt_adv_xsp&AFID=google&fndsrc=tgtao&DFA=71700000086347447&CPNG=PLA_Health%2BShopping_Traffic_Local_Traffic%7CHealth_Ecomm_Essentials&adgroup=SC_Health&LID=700000001170770pgs&LNM=PRODUCT_GROUP&network=g&device=m&location=9057239&targetid=pla-331942173826&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAAD-5dfbOmzJ4TbK8uOwlvQiAHCMUi&gclid=Cj0KCQjw6PGxBhCVARIsAIumnWY6DlXnKQLiZvqEMIqbsFcSMxNJVcwETwev8AqRPqCNXW7YUN48SOYaAqsDEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds">LINK</a>

EDIT
looked into exact whey vs pea/rice cost:
whey .024$/g (even on sale): <a href="https://bulkfoods.com/products/whey-protein-concentrate-80.html">bulkfoods.com/products/whey-protein-concentrate-80.html</a>
pea-rice .018$/g: <a href="https://bulkfoods.com/pure-protein-powders/pea-protein-powder.html">bulkfoods.com/pure-protein-powders/pea-protein-powder.html</a> <a href="https://bulkfoods.com/pure-protein-powders/brown-rice-protein-powder.html">bulkfoods.com/pure-protein-powders/brown-rice-protein-powder.html</a>
pea-rice is 75% the price of whey! if you spend $1000 you'll still have $250 if you buy pea-rice. that's Wii-money
(soy is cheaper at .016$/g but soy phytoestrogens may have an impact on your endocrine system)
(cricket powder, cheapest 'meat' i know of, is .039$/g)
