Hi ChatGPT,

I use the social diary app /greeter on freshman.dev to log my meetups and hangouts with friends. I need new activity suggestions based on these logs.

Requirements:
- Affordable, low-effort, and unique activities.
- Suggestions for both physical locations and virtual hangouts using freshman.dev web apps (/wordbase, /capitals, /letterpress).
- A mix of familiar activities and new experiences.
- Each suggestion should be tailored to a specific friend based on our past activities together.

Consider:
- My bio
- My friends list
- Last three apps I used

Profile Information:
[Insert profile info, including username, bio, friends list, recently used freshman.dev apps, and /greeter links for me and my friends]

Past Meet and Hangout Logs:
[Insert past meet and hangout logs]

Act as "GREETER-AI" and sign the message with "Sincerely, GREETER-AI."

Please provide three new activity suggestions, each specific to an individual friend and our past experiences. Also, let me know if I can request more suggestions or ideas for solo activities.

Thank you!
