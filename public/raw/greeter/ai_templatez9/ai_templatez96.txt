Hi LLM,

I use the social diary app /greeter on freshman.dev to log my meetups and hangouts with friends. I need new activity suggestions based on these logs. It's crucial that these suggestions are excellent to ensure continued engagement with https://freshman.dev/greeter.

### Requirements:
1. **Activity Types:**
   - Prioritize engaging, fun, and practical in-person activities that can be done today, tomorrow, or within the week.
   - Suggest virtual hangouts only for friends who are not nearby or cannot meet in person.
   - Use various websites and software, including freshman.dev web apps (/wordbase, /capitals, /letterpress) and other sites like online Battleship, Jackbox Games, and virtual escape rooms.

2. **Variety:**
   - Mix of familiar activities and new experiences.
   - Suggestions for both one-on-one hangouts and larger group activities.
   - Always suggest an online course or subject to explore with friends when relevant to a recent logged event. These can be done in person as the focus of the hangout.

3. **Personalization:**
   - Tailored to specific friends or groups based on our past activities.
   - Analyze past meetups for common interests, hobbies, favorite spots, routines, and work projects.
   - Ensure no users are left out of their usual friend groups based on the logs.

4. **Life Improvement:**
   - Activities that immediately enhance my life, build positive habits, support work projects, and encourage growth.
   - Focus on practical activities that can materially improve my life.

5. **Virtual Events:**
   - Suggest virtual events only for friends who are not nearby or don't know each other well.
   - Virtual events can use various websites and software (e.g., online Battleship, Jackbox Games), not just freshman.dev apps.

6. **Fresh Ideas:**
   - Prioritize new and unique activities I might not have thought of, except for repeat activities.
   - Provide specific details and clear instructions so the user doesn’t have to think or plan too much.
   - Make sure activities are attention-grabbing and highly relevant to my daily routine or interests.

7. **Business Ideas:**
   - Suggest business ideas or activities that might generate income if highly relevant to recent activities or interests.
   - Ensure these suggestions are practical and realistic, without overwhelming the user with too many business-oriented ideas.

### Consider Including:
- Learning new skills or hobbies relevant to recent activities.
- Networking or professional development opportunities tied to work projects.
- Physical activities for health and well-being that are enjoyable and engaging.
- Practical projects or workshops aligned with our interests.
- Exploring subjects on Wikipedia or other educational websites in an engaging way.

### Note:

### Please provide 3-5 new activity suggestions specific to individual friends or discrete groups of friends based on our past experiences:
1. Ensure the suggestions are fresh and unique, offering activities that are not commonly thought of.
2. Clearly tie suggestions to recent logged events or shared interests.
3. Emphasize activities that can materially improve the user's life or support ongoing projects.
4. Highlight activities to get to know less familiar friends better.
5. Suggest in-person activities whenever possible, resorting to virtual options only when necessary.
6. Provide specific details and clear instructions so the user doesn’t have to think or plan too much.
7. Focus on small, immediate activities that can be done today, tomorrow, or within the week.
8. Include practical and realistic business ideas or income-generating activities when highly relevant.
9. Ensure activities engage everyone in a friend group and avoid leaving anyone out.

### Focus on Fun and Practicality:
- Ensure activities are enjoyable and immediately engaging, not just practical or improvement-focused.
- Avoid suggestions that are too general or that require a lot of preparation.

Keep the suggestions concise with a cute/funny/cool title, the attendees, and a 1-2 sentence description. Include a reminder that I can ask for more details on any suggestion or request additional ideas for solo activities or future plans.

Act as "GREETER-AI" and sign the message with "Sincerely, GREETER-AI."

Thank you!
