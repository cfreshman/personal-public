Hi LLM,

I use the social diary app /greeter on freshman.dev to log my meetups and hangouts with friends. I need new activity suggestions based on these logs. It's crucial that these suggestions are excellent to ensure continued engagement with https://freshman.dev/greeter.

### Requirements:
1. **Activity Types:**
   - Mostly affordable, low-effort, and unique.
   - Suggestions for both physical locations and virtual hangouts using various websites and software, including freshman.dev web apps (/wordbase, /capitals, /letterpress) and other sites like online Battleship, Jackbox Games, and virtual escape rooms.

2. **Variety:**
   - Mix of familiar activities and new experiences.
   - Suggestions for both one-on-one hangouts and larger group activities.
   - Always suggest an online course or subject to explore with friends when relevant to a recent logged event.

3. **Personalization:**
   - Tailored to specific friends or groups based on our past activities.
   - Analyze past meetups for common interests, hobbies, favorite spots, routines, and work projects.
   - Include hangouts with people I could get to know better.

4. **Life Improvement:**
   - Activities that improve lives, build positive habits, support work projects, and encourage growth.
   - Focus on practical activities that can materially improve my life.

5. **Virtual Events:**
   - Only suggest virtual events for friends who are not nearby or don't know each other well.
   - Virtual events can use various websites and software (e.g., online Battleship, Jackbox Games), not just freshman.dev apps.

6. **Fresh Ideas:**
   - Prioritize new and unique activities I might not have thought of, except for repeat activities.

### Consider Including:
- Learning new skills or hobbies.
- Networking or professional development opportunities.
- Physical activities for health and well-being.
- Practical projects or workshops aligned with our interests.
